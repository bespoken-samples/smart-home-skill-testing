# What Is This?
This is a simple project that demonstrates automated testing for a Smart Home skill.

Use this as a template for setting up automated testing for your own Smart Home skill.

# How Does It Work?
It uses Bespoken's Virtual Device API to interact with Smart Home device via Alexa programmatically. The test is intended to be run on a regular interval, optionally reporting results to DataDog for more advanced reporting and notifications.

It also shows an external API being used - the intention is this will be the canonical API for the device. This is used to ensure devices are in the proper state to be tested, and that the commands to Alexa have had the intended effect.

Most Smart Home devices have APIs like this - for our tests here, we just use a mock. In real test, an implementer should replace the mock with their real API calls.

# Test Overview
There are two test suites - [single-device-test.js](single-device-test.js) and [multi-device-test.js](multi-device-test.js).

The first one shows testing a single device, the second one shows a slightly more complex test that uses a CSV file to test a number of devices.

The basic sequence is simple:
1) Initialize the device to a "clean" state
2) Interact with Alexa - "alexa, turn the bedroom lamp off"
3) Check with the device itself via its API to confirm the result
4) Report the results to DataDog 

For our multi-device test, the device names being tested come from a CSV file. For those wishing to test many different devices, this example shows a simple but powerful approach to doing this.

# Getting Setup
To get setup, you will need the following (and some of this you likely already have):
1) [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2) Project dependencies installed:
Open a command-line window, and run `npm install` in the directory where this project is installed
3) A Bespoken Virtual Device token:
Follow these directions to get one - [Bespoken Virtual Device setup](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/setup). 
4) A DataDog account:
This is optional - but DataDog is a nice tool for visualizing metrics as well as configuring notifications when there are issues.

The virtual device token as well as the Data Dog API key should go into the .env file. If no DataDog API key is supplied, this steps wills be skipped.

Once configured, you can run the tests:
`npm test`

# More Information
## Continuous Integration
These tests are configured to be run on a five-minute interval via Circle CI.

The Circle CI workflow to do this is in this file: [./.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml).

For more detailed information, the Circle CI docs are [here](https://circleci.com/docs/).

If you setup your own automated test using Circle CI, be sure to set the environment variables within Circle.
